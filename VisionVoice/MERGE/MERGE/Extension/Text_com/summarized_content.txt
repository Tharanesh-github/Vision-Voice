**Exponential Functions:**

* Functions where the variable (x) is in the exponent, instead of the base.

**Graphing Exponential Functions:**

* Plot the points (x, y) where y is the value of the function for different values of x.
* The shape of the graph depends on the base (a):
    * Base > 1: Graph rises to the right.
    * Base < 1: Graph falls to the right.

**General Form of an Exponential Function:**

```
y = C * a^x
```
* C is a constant.
* a is the base.

**Exponential Function Properties:**

* The graph never intersects the x-axis, but gets closer as x increases/decreases.

**Rewriting Expression:**

Given: 0.25^x = (1/4)^x

Rewrite as: 0.25^x = 4^(-x)
