1_image001.png," The image shows a Cartesian coordinate plane with four quadrants. The quadrants are labeled I, II, III, and IV, starting from the top right and going counterclockwise. Each quadrant is labeled with the signs of the x- and y-coordinates of the points in that quadrant. For example, the points in quadrant I have positive x-coordinates and positive y-coordinates.

There are four points plotted on the graph: (-3, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (-1, -3). The point (-3, 2) is in quadrant II because it has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate. The point (1, 2) is in quadrant I because it has a positive x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate. The point (2, 1) is also in quadrant I. The point (-1, -3) is in quadrant III because it has a negative x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate."
